    "text": "The TSS Earnslaw isn't just a cruise — she's a 1912 coal-fired steamship, one of the oldest in the southern hemisphere. Go below deck and watch the stokers shovelling coal into the furnace. The Walter Peak farm experience on the other side is great for kids — sheep shearing, dog trials, and an incredible afternoon tea. Book the lunchtime BBQ for the best value. The sunset cruise is romantic but you don't get the Walter Peak experience.",

The Kiwi Birdlife Park is the right length for tiny attention spans. The gondola ride is exciting and the Stratosfare buffet means no waiting for food with hangry toddlers. Skip anything that says 'ages 5+' — they mean it. Bring the pushchair for the waterfront but leave it behind for anything involving steps or gravel.",
